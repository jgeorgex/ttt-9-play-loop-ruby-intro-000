# Make sure to execute #play below

=begin
Edit `bin/play` to include a call to `#play`, passing it the `board` as an argument.
You can add that line to the `bin/play` CLI in advance of actually defining the `#play`
method in `lib/play.rb`. If you try running your CLI now, you'll get a `NoMethodError`
about an undefined method `#play`, which is fine because that's what we're about to define.
